		<h3 class="centered">Project: Server project</h3>
		<h3>Reflective statement</h3>
		<b><i>Description:</i></b>
		<p>
		In this project we made a network with cloud capability. Five different components had to be built in order for this to work. We needed three different servers(DNS,DHCP,WEB), we then needed to configure a firewall and a desktop/client. Using all open source software and virtual machines we were able to create a network with a firewall for security and SSH capability that would allow an admin to connect to any of the three server via an end-to-end encryption connection that was routed through the firewall.
		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Analysis:</i></b>
		<p>
		The very step was to read the complete lab twice and to fully understand the requirements or to at least have an idea of where this lab is headed. We then as a class built a network diagram that would give us a visual of the different components, how they are connected, and how they are connected. This diagram included details like the name, IP address, hostname and password of each component (You can see this chart below). The next step was to install the open source software and configure each component according to the lab steps. Many problems arose during this part of the project. Problems downloading updates because of no internet connectivity was a big issue. We use port 80 for other classes and other applications so I had to go kill services that were blocking the port. Compared to other issues that was an easy one. More problems while setting up the configuration files. Sometimes it would be human errors like a type-o, other times there would be the frustrating issue that no one knew how to help me. At one point I had to completely reinstall and configure my DNS server. Sometimes that happens and I learned to stay calm and figure out a solution after some huffing and puffing.   

		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Synthesis:</i></b>
		<p>
		   This project was crafted to show that with a few simple tools and some knowledge about networking you can build your network in no time. One thing I learned was to remain calm and really analyze the problem. A few times I thought I did everything right and it would turn out to be a colon or a wrong IP address somewhere. I loved the fact that we learned how to properly configure a firewall and run a cloud off of it.  
		

		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Goal Setting:</i></b>
		<p>
		 One short term goal that I have set for myself is to really study this project until I know exactly what each component does down to its core. I can accomplish this by reading the lab and inspecting the network I have built.
		One long term goal I have set for myself is to keep my networking knowledge progressing over the years. I have heard that in the IT field there is a big separation between networkers and software developers. I would like to be an exception to that fact.

		<h2 class="centered">Class: Open Source</h2>
		<h3 class="centered">Project: DHCP Server Lab</h3>
		<h3>Reflective statement</h3>
		<b><i>Description:</i></b>
		<p>
		 In this project we were tasked to set up a DHCP sever. DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. DHCP is use to automatically configure clients with an IP address. We used open source software and virtual machines to simulate this project in a controlled environment. Once installed we enabled the firewall to monitor traffic that will be coming and out of the firewall.  

		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Analysis:</i></b>
		<p>
		The very step was to read the complete lab twice and to fully understand the requirements or to at least have an idea of where this lab is headed. I began by installing an iso version of a 16.04 Ubuntu server. Then lab was pretty straight forward and mainly involved editing existing configuration files. The only issues I ran into were human error issues like type-oâ€™s or pluggin in the wrong IP address.
		

		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Synthesis:</i></b>
		<p>
		The goal of this lab was to learn how to configure IP addresses automatically using a DHCP server. An important lesson I learned in this lad is to not rush the editing and to pay close attention to what I am typing.
