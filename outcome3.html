		<h1 class="centered">Artifact 1</h1>
		<h2 class="centered">Class: Database Systems</h2>
		<h3 class="centered">Project: Normalize this</h3>
		
		<p>
		Normalize this was a lab we had to do to normalize data. This data was provided in an excel document. Before we could turn this data into a database we first had to normalize the data to a 1NF standard. This meant that All key attributes in the data are defined. I eliminated repeating data by making sure each row and column had only one value. 
		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		No real bugs happened in this lab. The major issues were learning how to use excel. If there is a value in a cell that has a blank space above or below it, it will not normalize the data. Different entries for the same person were a major issue in the un-normalized data. I learned that focusing on that helped to boil down the data into smaller parts by combining records that belonged together.  

		   
		</p>
	
		<p>
		   What I have taken away from this lab is that data in a database must meet a standard. BY assuring your data meets this standard you add value to your records. Not to mention it makes for more precise querying and data manipulation.  
		

		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		My short term goal is to study in more detail the 5 normal forms. I want to have this information embedded so that I can use it in the future. 
		A long-term goal that I have set for myself is to be conscious of the data you are working with. I want to always have normalization in the back of my head to make sure I am working with goo data.

		<h3 class="centered">Project: Stone Store
		</h3>
	
		<p>
		Stone Store was a website we were asked to make by using an MVC framework. MVC stands for Model View Controller. The MVC framework we learned and applied to this project is the .NET framework. In this store we made a database for the products of the store. Or database had 10 different categories per product.
		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		A key component of this website is that it needed to have a search a full functioning filtering system. This filter would weed out the categories of stone you didnâ€™t want to see. In order for this to happen, my database had to be spot on accuracy. I ran into some issues with my data early on and I addresses the issues by making sure my data was normalized.
