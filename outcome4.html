		<h3>Reflective statement</h3>
		<b><i>Description:</i></b>
		<p>
		In Big Data project, we worked in groups of three. We were asked to make an array with at least 100 different fields and with a minimum of 3 attributes per field. The end goal of this project was to make a responsive website that had the data manipulated three different ways. This involved using four three different languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Analysis:</i></b>
		<p>
		One of the hardest parts of this project was linking the charts we had chosen to display data with our actual data. This required writing scripts using JavaScript. We had not used JavaScript prior to this class so it made the task even harder. Nevertheless with enough research and staying after school for help, we were able to link the charts to our data. This aloud us to manipulate data three different was.  

		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Synthesis:</i></b>
		<p>
		  Something I learned from this experience is that JavaScript is a key component to making web based applications.
			One thing I would have like is to learn JavaScript in my first semester when we were taught HTML and CSS.
  
		

		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Goal Setting:</i></b>
		<p>
		A short term goal is to watch tutorials and master JavaScript. I will do research and find the best foundation-building JavaScript tutorials to watch 
		One Long term goal I have set for myself is to build a web application that uses one of the bif three JavaScript libraries(React, Angular, or Vue).

		<h2 class="centered">Class: Web Publishing</h2>
		<h3 class="centered">Project: Home Work 2</h3>
		<h3>Reflective statement</h3>
		<b><i>Description:</i></b>
		<p>
		In this project, we were asked to make a website that displayed photos dynamically from a database. We used HTML,CSS, PHP, and JQUERY. PHP and JQUERY were used to make the photos show up dynamically. We made functions that had a while loop that would iterate through our database of photos. We used JQUERY to make the initial connection to the database. Our database had to be on a remote server, so I opened a Go Daddy account. 
		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Analysis:</i></b>
		<p>
		One of the learning curves in this project came while using Go Daddy. Learning the C-Panel was key to mastering the hosting service. An even bigger speed bump was learning how to write object-oriented PHP. This was vital in order to make the pictures show up on the website. I had so stay after a few times to receive help from my professor. I was able to complete the project and meet all the requirements in the end. 

		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Synthesis:</i></b>
		<p>
		   This experience taught me that PHP could be used to write object-oriented code. Another thing I learned was how to dynamically render picture in a website. This is important because that is how most websites will pull their pictures and other information they want to display. This way all they have to do is change the record in the database and leave the website files untouched.  
		

		   
		</p>
		<b><i>Goal Setting:</i></b>
		<p>
		A short-term goal is to watch tutorials and master PHP. I will do research and find the best foundation-building PHP tutorials to watch 
	One Long term goal I have set for myself is to build a web application that uses one of the PHP to secure logins and other sensitive information on the website.
