		<h2 class="centered">Class: Database Servers</h2>
		<h3 class="centered">Project: Adventure Works 2012</h3>
		
		<p>
		In my Database Servers class, we learned how important it is to know the company business model before developing a database. We worked closely with "Adventure Works 2012". Adventure Works is a sample database that replicates what a real database might look like in a real business setting. This sample database allowed me to run queries from Microsoft SQL & MySQL to obtain desired results or outputs. Before running any queries, I had to study the database structure in order to learn how different tables were connected or not.
		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		This assignment intended to simulate real world requests. For instance, you may be asked to do a report that includes information pulled from the database in a specific way to show a trend or pattern. What this class taught me is to avoid jump right into a query, and to take a step back to study the database itself. In the beginning, our instructor would give us a set of results/outputs that she would like to see from the Adventure works database. The instructions for the first example in the picture below would have looked something like this: Output the pay rate and commission earned by all employees that hold a “territoryID” equal to 6.
		When you break the output down it required fields from two different tables. Occasionally you get lucky and those tables share a common field. This time was one of those lucky times. 

		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		A short-term goal I have set for my self is to read the directions carefully and take it a step at a time. I have to make sure I know exactly what tables need to be pulled and all the fields required to be in the output.
		Along term goal I have set for myself is to learn new ways of querying a database. With enough research I can find a way to make a query faster

		<h1 class="centered">Artifact 2</h1>
		<h2 class="centered">Class: Business Architecture</h2>
		<h3 class="centered">Project: Hypnogeeks</h3>
		
		<p>
		 A group that consisted of myself and four others were given a task to make a company from scratch and build a website for it.our website had to have a minimum of five pages. We had to start by Figuring out what type of service our company would offer. Then came the fun part naming it. We named out company Hypno-Geeks. Essentially our company would rival newegg.ccom and pcpartpicker.com. One key components that shaped the business structure was the company mythology. 
		 The company mythology consists of coming up with an idea or a vision the company should follow, a business plan, product development, define customer, marketing plan. 

		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Once we decided what kind of company we were going to develop. Next came the design of the website. By sketching low fidelity screens of what each page should look like, we got a sense of the feel of the website. During this step we had to make big decisions like what color scheme to use. What each component of the website will look and feel like. The harder step came when we had to split up the coding. How would we update each other with the changes? How would we make it all one whole website in the end? Who would code what aspect of the website? We solved this by creating backlogs. A backlog is a way of breaking down a task into smaller pieces that to be delegated to an individual. From these backlogs, we created a sprint. Sprints are goals you set in a determined amount of time to begin your individual part of the project. Last step is creating a burn-down. A burn-down is a spreadsheet that keeps track of progress. When you manually enter your backlogs items and check them off they are burned-down.

		<p>
		I think this project was crafted with the idea of learning how to structure a company. When you structure a company properly, data will be much easier to develop and keep in order. Another thing that was great about this project was the team experience. This parallel with a real-life developing environment will definitely come in handy in the real world. One thing I would improve is finding better tools to collaborate as a team. A tool that can keep track of the project as whole, code, excel sheets, designs, and it allows each member to log-in and view updates and progress.    
		

		   
		</p>
	
		<p>
		One short term goal I have set for myself is to learn how to better communicate as a team. I can reach this goal by researching how to make meetings more efficient and productive. Specifically in a developing environment.
		One Long-term goal I have set for myself is to develop a task manager for developers. This is a long term goal because I feel I must enter the life of a developer and find patterns and chances for improvement in the developing stages. Then I can start designing a tool that can benefit and improve productivity in a developer’s life.
