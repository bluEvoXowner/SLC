		<h2 class="centered">Class: Business architecture</h2>
		<h3 class="centered">Project: Agile Project methology</h3>
		
		<p>
		In business Architecture we learned a tool that helps in the development cycle, it called Agile. Agile allows flexibility during the project cycle. If the client wants to change a requirement it shouldnâ€™t be a huge deal if agile has been applied properly. It forces people and developers to work closer together on a given project. This allows for face-to-face interactions with your team members, the most efficient way to convey information. 
		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		We used Agile in all of our major projects in our Business architecture class. We start by picking roles in our team. You can be a team member, scrum master , or product owner. The scrum master is the lead in the four daily meeting. They are in charge of keeping the meetings short but informative. Anytime a team member finishes an item on a sprint they must articulate what they have done to the team so that we are all on the same page. This is especially important when it comes to software. You need to be able to leave identifying comment in your code and explain it to anyone without a problem. 

		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		 This process taught me that team work can be very productive if the right steps are taken. Agile is big part of the developing industry and it will only help if I learn it thoroughly.
  
		

		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
			A short term goal is to learn Agile and all of its foundational properties. Companies are relaying on Agile now more than ever before, and it would benefit me to learn it by heart.One Long term goal I have set for myself is to eventually become a project manager for a software department.

		<h1 class="centered">Artifact 2</h1>
		<h2 class="centered">Class: Advanced Topics</h2>
		<h3 class="centered">Project: Capstone</h3>
		
		<p>
		The Capstone project involded making a responsive website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL. I was lucky in group of five, because the website we were working on will be hosted I real life. A teacher that works at Dunwoody is involved with a charity in Sudan. The charity is a school for the blind of all ages, consisting of adults mostly. These adults have been making art using beads. They can make anything from hot-plate mats to earrings, bracelets, and necklaces. The instructor at Dunwoody deals with all of the sales manually right now and she asked us to make an ecommerce website for her and the Foundation. 
		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		This Assignment Involved heavy teamwork. Each one of us was in charge of a different component of the website. This meant that we had to properly label our code and convey exactly how it work to each other.   

		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		   This project was designed to combine all the major components it takes to make a professional style website. One thing that I would changes is our team work. We could have done a better job at communicating.   
		

		   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		A short term goal is to learn how to properly secure admin logins and online transactions.
		One Long term goal I have set for myself is to build a web application using all of the components used in this project.
